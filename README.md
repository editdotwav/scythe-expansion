# Scythes that are not for farming.
 
## Inspired by the Clowns Scythe made by doctor4t. Check him out!

 
The scythes are vanilla-styled, so it will not stick out during gameplay too much.

In combat, the Scythes are a mix with a sword and an axe with their respected material. They have a sweep attack, similar to a sword, but they have a slower cooldown, similar to an axe. The main takeaway in combat is how much of the screen the Scythe covers when held, but if that isn't a problem, then the Scythe is the better alternative for the boring sword.
